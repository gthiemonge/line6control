Line 6 Control
==============

Line 6 Control is a PyGTK application which can control a Line 6 USB device as the PODxt.

This is an experimental application, only few features are implemented :

    * Channel switching,
    * Reading and writing parameters for Amplification, Stomp Box, Mod Box and Delay Box.

Requirements
------------

    * Line 6 Control works with Markus Grabner's Line 6 USB driver (http://www.tanzband-scream.at/line6/). Some recent Linux kernels have older versions of this driver (podxtpro.ko in Ubuntu Dapper's 2.6.15 kernel release),
    * Python,
    * PyGTK (python-gtk2 package on Ubuntu Dapper),
    * Glib C Headers (libglib2.0-dev package).


Running
-------

Type "make".
When the python module is compiled, run Line 6 Control with "./main.py"


Known issues
------------

    * Time and Speed parameters are not handled as they should be. Using their controls in Line 6 Control can crash the application,
